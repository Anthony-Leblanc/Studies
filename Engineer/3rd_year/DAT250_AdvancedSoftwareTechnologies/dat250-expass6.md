## Experiment 1: Model-View-Controller Web Applications

No issues encountered.

## Experiment 2: Single-page applications

I could not complete this task because of the problems encountered. Although I understand how the API works, it was difficult for me to set up the linking of the http part with java.

```
__ Update__
I've been able to understand how to implement CRUD https, create methods and bind them to users actions after more time spenting to this assignment.

To start the application, I used the following command : json-server --watch db.json
Then start the application.
```
