## Experiment 1 : Getting started

When I tried to run the program, I was told that the port I was using (8080) was occupied. I tried to kill it but couldn't. Consequently, I had to specify which port to use for the program.
In the "application.properties" file in the resources folder, I wrote "server.port=9090". Then the program worked.

## Experiment 2 : Spring Boot

Same issue as before, I wasn't able to use port 8080. I added a resources folder as well as a "application.properties" file with "server.port=9090" written in it.
The command given in the tutorial in order to run curl didn't work for me. I had to write : "curl http://localhost:9090".

## Experiment 3 : REST service

No other issue.

## Experiment 4 : Data Access

No issue either.
