## Experiment 1: Installation

I had problems installing RabbitMQ and Erlang/OTP because I used to install software on my "D:" drive. Apparently changing RabbitMQ installation path (no problem for Erlang/OTP) causes problems. I tried different ways to install RabbitMQ on my "D:" drive with no success, so I finally installed it on my "C:" drive and everything worked.

## Experiment 2: Hello World

No problems encountered. I used java and maven with IntelliJ IDEA to test the experiments. First, I had to set the dependencies as libraries for this to work:

Second, I had to modify the command windows to run to create the classes although I don't think that's really necessary as I'm running the class using Intellij IDEA.
