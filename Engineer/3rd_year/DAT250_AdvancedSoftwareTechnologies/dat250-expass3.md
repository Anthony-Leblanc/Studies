# Report for 3rd assignment


## Installation and uses of MongoDB

No problems during the intallations have been encounter.
Some problems appeared while using : MongoDB Compass, indeed, the command map reduce is not supported. When I tried to use this command a message appeared in the mongo shell in MongoDB Compass telling that :

And the program is kept loading.

So I used "mongosh" to run the codes using map reduce.

## Issues


## Side note

This lab assignment was done in collaboration with the following people : Aeneas RUS LIN and Jingwen CHEN




***
In particular, you should write about:

Technical problems that you encountered during installation and use of MongoDB and how you resolved

Screenshots for:

The correct validation of the installation package (v)

Relevant results obtained during Experiment 1 (it is not necessary to put a single screenshot on each substep, but at least one significant from each CRUD operation).

Experiment 2 example working and the additional Map-reduce operation (and its result) developed by each of you.

Reason about why your implemented Map-reduce operation in Experiment 2 is useful and interpret the collection obtained.

Any pending issues with this assignment which you did not manage to solve

The hand-in should be written in English.
