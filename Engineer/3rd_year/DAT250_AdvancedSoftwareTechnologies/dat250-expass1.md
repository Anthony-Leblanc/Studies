_ As a windows computer user, I've encounter some difficulties to install Apache Maven because I always managed to use an other computer with a distribution of Linux intalled. So I had do to edit for the first time the paths of my system to install Apache Maven correctly. A simple windows key and write "path" (even if my system is in french" and it showed me a window to manage the paths of the system.

_ To check is the software development worked I used the command heroku local web and I updated my web page to see the logs. At least, if there is an update in the logs it's that a communication have been accomplished.

_ I encountered one problem with Heroku platform. It was because I forgot one step of the installation of Apache Maven.

_ I wrote this document 2 days after the session, I don't know if you will found the informations you need :
